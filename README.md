# DSA-with-JAVA

My DSA practice in Java while learning basics + interview prep.

## 🎯 Overview

This repository is a collection of Java programs created while I learn core Java and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA).  
It is aimed at students who want clear, simple examples to understand logic and build problem-solving skills.

## 📚 Current Topics

Currently covered:

- Basics of Java (syntax, variables, input/output)
- Conditionals (if, if-else, nested if, switch)
- Loops (for, while, do-while, basic patterns)

Each topic is organised into separate folders and files so it is easy to navigate and run specific programs.

## 📌 Future Topics I Will Add

I plan to gradually add:

- Arrays and String problems
- Methods and recursion
- Searching and sorting algorithms
- Basic DSA:
  - Linked List
  - Stack and Queue
- Advanced DSA (later stage):
  - Trees
  - Graphs
  - Dynamic Programming (DP)

This section will be updated as new topics and folders are added.

## 🤝 Contributions & Usage

This repository is primarily for my personal learning.  
However, other students are welcome to:

- Clone and run the programs
- Use the code as a reference for their own practice
- Suggest improvements via issues or pull requests

If you find this helpful, consider starring the repository to follow the progress.
